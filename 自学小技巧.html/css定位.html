  <div class="text">1 Can you imagine waiting ten years to take the perfect photograph? With phones accessible in our
    pocket, it's easier than ever to take photos of nature and wildlife, providing we can find it. But what skills do
    the most successful wildlife photographers have? Talent, patience, curiosity and resilience.

    2 The winner of Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2025 was South African wildlife photographer Wim van den Heever.
    His shot depicts a brown hyena lit up in an abandoned mining town in the Namibian desert and was the culmination of
    ten years' work. So why was it so difficult to capture? The subject is a shy creature, mostly active at night, and
    the Namib Desert often succumbs to thick fog, while easterly winds can pile sand up to a metre high. "I had one or
    two years where cameras just got absolutely trashed," he says.

    3 The images captured in this competition are not just stunning, they are also powerful glimpses into the fragile,
    complex and beautiful ecosystems we share. The picture that won Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2025 is of a
    longhorn beetle appearing to look out at big logging machinery which is chopping down its habitat. The photographer
    has cleverly framed the beetle and machinery to be equal in size, which one of the judges commented on. "The
    photographer has given M. asper authority in this image. It does exactly what a strong photograph should do – it
    increases our understanding.”

    4 A strong visual can not only provoke the urgency of conservation but can also give us glimpses into the
    unexpected. This year a Belgian photographer captured a startling image of one of the world's only maritime lions.
    These big cats moved from their traditional hunting grounds in the Namib Desert in 2017 and have since learnt to
    hunt fur seals along the Atlantic coast. "The photo shows how resilient these animals are… that they change their
    habitat to survive," says the photographer, Van Malderen.
